        <p>A delicious Classic Smash Burger featuring two thin, crispy-edged beef patties, melted American cheese, and caramelized onions on a toasted brioche bun.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb ground beef (80/20 fat ratio recommended);</li>
            <li>2 brioche buns;</li>
            <li>2 slices of American cheese;</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced;</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter;</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste;</li>
            <li>Pickles and burger sauce (optional).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the meat:</strong> Divide the ground beef into 4 loosely packed balls (about 2 oz each). Do not press them yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> Spread a little butter on the buns and toast them in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Smash the patties:</strong> Increase the heat to high. Place the meat balls on the hot skillet. Use a heavy spatula (or a buger press) to smash them down as flat as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and add onions:</strong> Season the patties generously with salt and pepper. Place the thinly sliced onions directly on top of the raw side of the patties.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip:</strong> Cook for about 2 minutes until the edges are crispy and browned. Flip the patties so the onions are now underneath, cooking into the meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> Place a slice of cheese on each patty and cook for another minute until melted.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Stack two patties on each toasted bun. Add pickles or sauce if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Enjoy your burger while it's hot and juicy!</li>
        </ol>
