# Odin Recipes - v2.0

This is the evolved version of my first web project. After learning more about the basics, I've refactored this recipe website to improve its structure and styling.

### Objectives
The main goal is to demonstrate my core Front-End skills, including:

- **Semantic HTML5**: Proper use of elements, tags, and attributes.
- **Content Formatting**: Creating clear hierarchies with headings, paragraphs, and text formatting.
- **Lists & Navigation**: Organizing data with ordered/unordered lists and connecting pages via internal/external links.
- **Media**: Optimized image implementation.
- **Modern CSS**: Applying styles to create a clean and responsive interface.
