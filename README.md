# odin-recipes
This is my first project, a basic recipes website using only HTML.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate my newly acquired HTML skills, like:

- Use of elements, tags and attributes;
- Writting of the HTML Boilerplate;
- Creating paragraphs, headings, bold text, italicized text and HTML comments;
- Creating unordered and ordered lists;
- Creating links to pages on my own website and other websites;
- Displaying images on a webpage using HTML.
